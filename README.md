# Real-time-vehicle-plate-detection


This project involves real-time vehicle number plate detection using Python, OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, and OpenPyXL. The system employs computer vision techniques through OpenCV for image processing and feature extraction, while Tesseract OCR is utilized for optical character recognition on the detected number plates. The recognized plate information is then stored in an Excel workbook using OpenPyXL, enabling efficient data management. This integrated solution offers a practical approach to automate vehicle identification and data logging in real-time scenarios.

Note: Make sure that you create a folder named "plates" in the main folder. That ensures to save the captured plates as img and excel format.
